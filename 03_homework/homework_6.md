**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


I am currently working in insurance sector where I have access to all the company data related to policy binding, underwriting, rates, previous history of each insured, claims record and other related data. It happens sometimes that some of my friends who have insurance with my company ask me for favor in terms of sharing company internal information like updates on their claim. As a resonsible professional, I always recommend them to connect to their claim adjuster who can better provide the case update and will guide them well for any next steps. Accessing and sharing of any information that is not directly related to my work comes under information breach that I would never committ.
